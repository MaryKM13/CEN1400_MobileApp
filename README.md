## Mary's Favorites
### Website Summary
The purpose of the **Mary's Favorites** website is to showcase the things Mary likes. There's lists of movies, music, and books, as well as some background information on who she is. There's also an interactive page that allows the user to enter their own favorites for Mary to see.
### Website Structure
The website structure is very straightforward. The homepage has a list of links to direct the site visitor to the Who and the What of the website, as well as links to Mary's favorite movies, favorite music, favorite books, and a form for the visitor to input their favorites.
### Webpage Descriptions
**Throughout**
The website was styled using jQuery Mobile and ThemeRoller.
Each page contains a header image. The colors of each reflect a combination of three swatches from ThemeRoller.
The icons shown in each list and button make use of the _ui-alt-icon_ class, making the image black instead of white.
Each page but the homepage has a navigation button in the upper right corner. Clicking that button will cause a navigation panel to slide out, with links to each page. In the upper left corner of each page but the homepage is a back button that lets the user return to the previous page.

**Homepage**
The homepage contains navigation links to each of the other pages.

**Who Is Mary?**
A brief description of Mary. 

**What Does Mary Like?**
An overview of subject matter of each list. The page uses jQuery Mobile grids to separate the three paragraphs.

**Mary's Favorite Movies**
An unordered list of five movies. Each list item includes the _data-icon="video"_ attribute.

**Mary's Favorite Music**
An unordered list of five songs, each of which link to their respective YouTube video. Each list item includes the _data-icon="audio"_ attribute.

**Mary's Favorite Books**
A filtered list of five books. Each list item includes the _data-icon="eye"_ attribute.

**Why and Feedback**
This page contains a textarea for the user to enter any feedback, as well as a form where the user can list their favorites, and vote which category they liked best. Pressing the _Submit Form_ button will display the user's lists of favorites at the top of the page through the use of web storage. Web storage also allows the form fields to retain the information that was input. Pressing the _Reset Form_ button clears the web storage, and pressing the _Submit Form_ button again removes the user displayed information by reloading the page.
